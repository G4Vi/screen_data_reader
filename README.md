screen_data_reader
==================

Read data from a screenshot or picture of screen

Used for parsing custom data format outputted by a psx app as the psx is too slow at generating QR codes.

See [PSX Data Dumper](https://github.com/G4Vi/tonyhax/blob/video_data_dumper/loader/datadumper.c)

Currently python2 and python3, but subject to change.
